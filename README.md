# MiscellaneousMath-DataStructures
Collection of reuploads of notable discrete math and data strucure programs I have created over the years. Some of these span from 2019 to present day.

They range from very short programs, to longer data structures.

I am still in the process of re-uploading everything, as some work is on a school server, some are on my replit and local machines.
