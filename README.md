# Miscellaneous Math And Data Structures

This is a collection of reuploads of notable discrete math and data strucure programs I have created over the years. These works span from 2019 to present day.

# Why reuploaded ? 
The work was scattered accross various platforms and devices. Some of this work was from the university unix server from where I attended school and some is from my replit and local machines. It made the most sense to me to collect all the work and upload it in one spot.
