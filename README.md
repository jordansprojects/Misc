This is a collection of reuploads of notable discrete math and data strucure programs I have created over the years. Some of these span from 2019 to present day.

They range from very short programs, to longer data structures.


# Why reuploaded ? 
Some of this work was from the university unix server for the computer science department, some are from my replit and local machines. It made the most sense to put them here.
