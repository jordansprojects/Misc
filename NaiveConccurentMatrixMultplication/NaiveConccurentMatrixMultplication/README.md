# NaiveConccurentMatrixMultplication

A program I made for a Programming Languages class to demonstrate the suitability and asychronousity of parallelism in F#. 

This project consists of two files.

* A soley sequential matrix multiplication program
* A matrix multiplication using Fsharps Async library to perform matrix multiplication in parallel.
